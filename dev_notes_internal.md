# AWS Super CLI - Development Notes & Roadmap

## 🎯 Mission Statement (Updated Based on User Polls)
Build the **AWS security and discovery tool** that solves the top pain points engineers actually face:
- **43%** struggle with switching between accounts → Multi-account support ✅ 
- **37%** hate dealing with long ARNs → Smart ARN display needed
- **71%** find security misconfigs the biggest headache in new accounts → Comprehensive security audit

**Tagline**: "Your AWS security and discovery command-line tool"

## 🔥 Core Value Proposition
**Primary**: Comprehensive security auditing across AWS accounts with actionable findings
**Secondary**: Beautiful, fast resource discovery with intelligent ARN handling

## 📊 Target Audience (Validated by Polls)
1. **Security engineers** doing rapid compliance checks (71% pain point)
2. **DevOps/SREs** managing multiple AWS accounts (43% pain point) 
3. **New engineers** onboarding to complex AWS setups
4. **Compliance teams** needing audit trails and reports

**These are PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS who need clean, efficient tools.**

## 🚀 Development Workflow Rules
1. **One feature at a time** - Complete one feature fully before starting the next
2. **Update this document** - Always update this roadmap when starting/completing features
3. **GitHub Issue Management** - MANDATORY for all issues:
   - **ALWAYS START**: Check GitHub issues before starting any work
   - **Token Setup**: Use `.env` file with `GH_TOKEN=github_pat_EXAMPLE...` (already in .gitignore)
   - **Token Usage**: `export GH_TOKEN=github_pat_EXAMPLE... && gh issue list --state=open`
   - **Check Issues**: `gh issue list --state=open` to see what needs work
   - **Document Progress**: Comment on GitHub issues as work progresses
   - **Update Status**: Update issue status (In Progress → Testing → Complete)
   - **Close Issues**: Close with detailed summary of implementation
   - **Reference Commits**: Include commit hashes and specific changes made
4. **README.md Updates** - MANDATORY for all feature changes:
   - Update README.md whenever new features are added or existing features change
   - Include examples of new functionality
   - Update installation/usage instructions if needed
   - Ensure documentation matches current feature set
5. **PyPI Release** - MANDATORY after every completed feature/issue:
   - Bump version number in setup.py and __init__.py
   - Create new PyPI release with changelog
   - Tag the release in GitHub with version number
   - Include release notes describing what changed
6. **GitHub first** - Commit and push every completed feature
7. **Feature branches** - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/security-iam-mfa`, `fix/issue-4-empty-error`)
8. **NO EMOJIS IN CLI** - CRITICAL: Never use emojis in CLI output. Professional, enterprise-grade tool only.

## 🔧 GitHub CLI Setup & Usage
**Token Location**: `.env` file in project root (excluded from git)
**Token Setup**: 
```bash
echo "GH_TOKEN=github_pat_EXAMPLE_TOKEN_REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL" > .env
```

**Daily Usage Commands**:
```bash
# Load token and check open issues
export GH_TOKEN=github_pat_EXAMPLE_TOKEN_REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL && gh issue list --state=open

# Comment on issue while working
gh issue comment <issue_number> --body "Working on this: <description>"

# Close issue when complete
gh issue close <issue_number> --comment "Completed: <summary of what was implemented>"
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL UI STANDARDS
**ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS IN CLI OUTPUT - MANDATORY RULE**
